Nudged elastic band example OH molecule on Cu substrate. The H atom has two enegetically equivalent positions pointing to the left/right of the O atom. To do a NEB calculation you have to modify the starting images since the linear interpolation moves the hydrogen straight through the oxygen atom. You do this by using the '-s' flag to initiate the geometries.

For instance:

NEB -s L R -n 11 

Creates 11 images where the H atom just moves through the oxygen.

The python script FixStartGeom.py:

python FixStartGeom.py 

edits the geometries fixing the O-H bond length and tries to equipartition the steps between the images. Then you can run the NEB calculation as usual, e.g.,

NEB -n 11 -p 8 L R 

At the end of the calculation you will find a very sharp barrier when the H is straight above the oxygen.

Note: The FixStartGeom.py script can be seen as an example of how to use python and Inelastica to control geometries.
