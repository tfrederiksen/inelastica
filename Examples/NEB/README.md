The NEB command calculates a series of images between the start and end image (which I usually call Left/Right L/R). It can be used simply as 'NEB L R' where L/R are directories which contain a subdirectory CGrun which contain the two geometries, a RUN.out file and a .XV file with the converged geometries.

NEB uses the SetupRuns part of inelastica which writes job files and submit them to the que system. It then waits for the jobs to complete before submitting new jobs with updated geometries to find the NEB solution. Please see the documentation about the '~/.pbs' directory and 'qsub' command useful for your cluster.
